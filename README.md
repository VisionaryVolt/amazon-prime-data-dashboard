##  Project Description
This project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into a presentation-ready **business intelligence dashboard**. Using Excel, I cleaned, structured, and visualized a dataset on Amazon Primeâ€™s movies and TV shows.  

The dashboard highlights key insights into Amazon Primeâ€™s catalog and provides an interactive way to explore trends, ratings, and geographical distribution.

The dataset includes detailed attributes of titles available on Amazon Prime, such as:  
- **Title** and **Director**
